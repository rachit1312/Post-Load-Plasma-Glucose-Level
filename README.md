The given dataset lists the glucose level reading of several pregnant women taken either during a survey examination or routine medical care. It specifies if the 2-hour post-load plasma glucose was at least 200 mg/dl.

I'll be performing the following tasks here:
1. Finding the features of the dataset
2. Finding the response label of the dataset
3. Creating a model to predict the diabetes outcome
4. Using training and testing datasets to train the model
5. Finally, checking the accuracy of the model.
I'll build Logistic Regression model to predict diabetes.

The repo includes '.names' file which contains all the column names, '.data' file which contains the dataset, this readme file, license, and my notebook titled 'Model to predict diabetes using logistic regression.ipynb'.
